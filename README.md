# CloudStock 📦📲

CloudStock is a lightweight NFC-powered inventory management system built for small-scale businesses and startups. It simplifies stock tracking by letting users scan NFC tags attached to inventory items—using just a smartphone. Every interaction updates a central database in real-time, with zero manual entry.

## 🧠 Abstract

This project presents an innovative inventory management system designed specifically for small enterprises, leveraging Near Field Communication (NFC) to streamline stock handling. Businesses can attach NFC tags to their products and use smartphones to scan items during inbound and outbound operations. These scans automatically sync with a centralized database, maintaining real-time inventory records without human error.

Compared to traditional barcode-based solutions, this approach is cost-effective and hardware-light, relying only on common NFC-capable smartphones. It's especially suited for businesses with limited resources that need accurate stock data and actionable insights without technical overhead.
